I am a 4th Year Statistics PhD Student at Trinity College Dublin.

My PhD is funded by Taighde Ã‰ireann - Research Ireland under a Government of Ireland Postgraduate (GOIPG) Scholarship.

My research is focused on developing statistical methods for automated cell population identification in flow cytometry data. I am particularly interested in model-based clustering and semi-supervised learning.

My primary supervisor is Dr. Arthur White (School of Computer Science and Statistics, TCD) and my secondary supervisor is Prof. Rachel McLoughlin (School of Biochemistry and Immunology, TCD).

I received a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Trinity College Dublin in 2021.
