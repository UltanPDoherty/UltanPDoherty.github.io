I am a 3rd Year Statistics Phd Student at Trinity College Dublin. My PhD is funded by the Irish Research Council (IRC) under a Government of Ireland Postgraduate (GOIPG) Scholarship.

My research is focused on developing statistical methods for automated cell population identification in flow cytometry data. I am particularly interested in model-based clustering and semi-supervised learning.
